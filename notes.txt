station:
    has list of if statements controlling flow of audio types i.e. music djspots intros ads news etc.
    
main thread should occasionally polls station_router which polls station to get currently playing
    but for now it just reads file as work around
        but doenst update properly when radio station is killed why?

todo:
use addnstr(window.getmaxyx()) to cut off text and stop crashes. scrollin text how?

research markov chains and finite state machines for radio logic. rename intro files to match songs

m key to toggle song vs radio vs no ads/news mode   and display mode by now playing

special highlighting for current station separate from highlighted station

themes in the settings.ini file

convert wav to mp3 then package up on mega

windows version
