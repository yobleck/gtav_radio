todo:
program is pegging one cpu core. maybe use time.sleep() to make it chill out

resize the ascii art for larger windows and try braille

save file for each station to pick up where left off (no seeking unfortunately)

audio file overlap?

research markov chains and finite state machines for radio logic. rename intro files to match songs
    m key to toggle song vs radio vs no ads/news mode   and display mode by now playing
    boils station.py files down into fewer files based on type of audio structure

windows version


todo low priority:

themes in the settings.ini file

dont use file for now playing. use multiprocessing variable pass through

fix scaling on larger windows







#for converting lots of files in subdirectories    
find ./to_mp3 -name '*.wav' | xargs -I $ ffmpeg -i $ -acodec libmp3lame $.mp3
#for renaming
find . -name "*.wav.mp3" -print0 | xargs -0 rename ".wav.mp3" ".mp3"
#for deleting
find . -name "*.wav" | xargs -I $ rm $
